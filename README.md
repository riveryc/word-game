├── index.html          # Main game interface
├── script.js           # Game logic with enhanced features
├── words.csv           # Word list with descriptions (CSV format)
├── server.py           # Simple HTTP server
└── README.md           # This file
```

## 📝 Customizing Words

### Local CSV File
Edit `words.csv` to add your own words with the 6-column format:

```csv
word,date,grade,source,Example sentence,description
cat,2024-01-15,2,phonics,The cat sat on the mat,A small furry animal that says meow
dog,2024-01-15,2,phonics,"My dog loves to play fetch, and he wags his tail",A friendly animal that barks and loves to play
elephant,2024-01-16,3,animals,The elephant has a long trunk and big ears,A huge gray animal
```

**Note**: The local CSV now uses the same 6-column format as Google Sheets for consistent filtering and features.

### Google Sheets Integration
Use Google Sheets for collaborative word management:

1. **Create a Google Sheet** with these columns:
   ```
   word | date | grade | source | example sentence | description
   ```

2. **Make it public**:
   - Click "Share" → "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set permission to "Viewer"

3. **Copy the URL** and paste it into the game

**Default Sample Sheet:**
The game comes pre-loaded with a sample Google Sheet:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D7-Ny0FuD4w3inEi_lt-kpv7M0f7d0shnmS5TpiWdl0/edit?gid=0#gid=0
```
You can use this immediately or replace it with your own sheet URL.

**Example Google Sheets format:**
```
word     | date       | grade | source  | example sentence              | description
cat      | 2024-01-15 | 2     | phonics | The cat sat on the mat        | (for future use)
dog      | 2024-01-15 | 2     | phonics | My dog loves to play fetch    | (for future use)
elephant | 2024-01-16 | 3     | animals | The elephant has a long trunk | (for future use)
```

**Format Notes:**
- **Required columns**: `word` and `example sentence` (others are optional)
- **Example sentences**: The target word will be hidden with underscores during gameplay
- **Description column**: Currently unused, reserved for future features

## 🔧 Network Troubleshooting

If you can't access the game from other devices:

```

### **Common Solutions**
1. **Firewall Issues**:
   - **macOS**: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall → Allow Python
   - **Windows**: Windows Defender → Allow an app → Add Python
   - **Linux**: `sudo ufw allow 8000` or disable firewall temporarily

2. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi network
   - Check if your router blocks device-to-device communication
   - Try accessing from the same computer first (`http://localhost:8000`)

3. **Port Issues**:
   - If port 8000 is busy, the server will show an error
   - Change the PORT variable in `server.py` to use a different port

### **Testing Steps**
1. ✅ Access works locally: `http://localhost:8000`
2. ✅ Server shows network IP when starting
3. ✅ Other device on same WiFi network
4. ✅ Use the exact IP shown by server
5. ✅ Firewall allows Python/port 8000
