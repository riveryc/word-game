## üìù Customizing Words

### Local CSV File
Edit `words.csv` to add your own words with the 6-column format:

```csv
word,date,grade,source,Example sentence,description
cat,2024-01-15,2,phonics,The cat sat on the mat,A small furry animal that says meow
dog,2024-01-15,2,phonics,"My dog loves to play fetch, and he wags his tail",A friendly animal that barks and loves to play
elephant,2024-01-16,3,animals,The elephant has a long trunk and big ears,A huge gray animal
```

**Note**: The local CSV now uses the same 6-column format as Google Sheets for consistent filtering and features.

### Google Sheets Integration
Use Google Sheets for collaborative word management:

1. **Create a Google Sheet** with these columns:
   ```
   word | date | grade | source | example sentence | description
   ```

2. **Make it public**:
   - Click "Share" ‚Üí "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set permission to "Viewer"

3. **Copy the URL** and paste it into the game

```
You can use this immediately or replace it with your own sheet URL.

```
word     | date       | grade | source  | example sentence              | description
